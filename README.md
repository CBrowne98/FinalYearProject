# Final Year Project
Final year project for my NFQ level 8/Honours Bachelor's of Science degree.

## Description

The goal of the project is to allow a user to access a web application in which they can fill out a questionnaire with information regarding their physical health after registering with a username and password.
This information is then taken by the flask application and using an existing machine learning model created from one of the files within the project to predict the fitness level of the user.
The label is then used by the flask application to select an exericse plan to display to the user which is stored in a MySQL database.
When the user returns to the website after logging in they will be shown their current plan but they can fill out the form again for a new plan.
